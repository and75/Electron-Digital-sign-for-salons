# Pr√©sentation

"AppSalon" is a "Multitouch" JQuery/Bootstrap OOP (Object-oriented programming) application
with a system of templates (managed with Mustache.js) that separate visualization from control (an almost MVC-like system).
The application is composed of a Core object which provides global services and functionalities:

- application initialization
- module initialization
- reading html templates
- performing timed functions
- utilities for reading and formatting data such as: json, array, images and objects
- interface with Electron's "main" and "render" processes

and a series of specialized module objects for the implementation of specific functions and the management of dedicated display modules (totem and wall).

- Sending static data and application state data to the server via cron

Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s- bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.
